### Medicare Overview
**What is Medicare**
- A healthcare insurance program for people who are 65 and older and some smaller groups with different disabilities or chronic illnesses.
**Parts A and B** - Traditional/Standard Medicare
- **A** - Hospital expenditures, copayment, not as simple as 80/20.
- **B** - Doctor expenditures, 80% covered, patient pays 20%.
- Do not cover prescription drugs, unless administered during a hospital stay.
- Very flexible in terms of accessibility, works almost anywhere in America.
- Part A is free if the recipient has payed their Medicare tax.
- Part B is payed, around $100/month (private policies could be $1000 or more).
**Part C** - Medicare Advantage, alternative to A, B, and D.
- CMS subsidized private insurance.
- Copayments and deductibles tend to be lower.
- Built in prescription coverage.
**Part D** - Extension meant to cover prescription drugs.
- CMS pays private companies to cover prescription drugs.
**Supplemental Policies** - Private insurance to cover what Medicare doesn't.
**Medicare vs Medicaid**
- Medicare is federal, while Medicaid is federal and state.
- Each state gets to choose who qualifies for Medicaid.
- Medicare targets older, retired people while Medicaid targets impoverished people.
- Run by the same organization...
	1. Executive Branch
	2. Health and Human Services (HHS)
	3. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS)
	4. Medicare and Medicaid are run separately
## Lecture 2 - Our Healthcare System
### Before the Affordable Care Act (ACA)
**Insurance Statistics**
- ~310 Million US Residents
	- 85% Are Insured
		- 54% Privately Insured
		- 31% Publicly Insured
	- 15% Are Uninsured
- If you don't have a job, you don't have insurance, and you probably can't afford private insurance.
**What is Medicaid?**
- Federal and state joint healthcare system.
- Meant to go to people who have a 'demonstrated need' for it.
- Majority of recipients are children, then adults, then disabled.
**Gaps in Medicaid**
- Childess adults don't qualify.
### The Affordabe Care Act - 2012
**Nationwide Healthcare Spending**
- After the ACA was passed, there was a brief period of decrease in spendin followed by a slight increase and then a 'stabilization'.
- In reality, the growth rate has stayed the same but this means that the actual amount spent is rising every year.
### Definitions
**Insurance Premium** - The amount of money that an insured person must pay for an insurance policy.
**Deductible** - Amount an insured person must pay during a policy period (a year) before the insurance plan takes affect.
**Copayment** - A flat-rate fee for each medical service.
**Coinsurance**
**Health Mainenance Organization (HMO)** - 
**Preferref Provider Organization (PPO)**
**High-Deductible Health Plan (HDHP)**
## Lecture 4 - Our Healthcare System, Contd.
### Spending in Perspective
**2011 Healthcare Spending**
- France spend $3 trillion for 66 million people on everything (GDP).
- US spent an equivalent on healthcare alone.
- US Healthcare System = 5th Largest World Economy
- Leading up to Affordable Care Act (2009-2010), healthcare spending rose by $100 billion.
### Who are the Uninsured?
**Arguments Against "Freeloaders"**
	Some groups are targeted as "lazy" who don't work or don't pay taxes. They are assumed to want free stuff and free stuff only. It is often argued that uninsured people fit into this category.
**Typical Uninsured American** - Statistics from Kaiser Family Foundation, 2010
- White - 14%
- African American - 23%
- Hispanic - 30%
- More than 3/4 in working families.
## Lecture 5 - After the ACA
**Spending Changes**
- Rate of increase decreases, this statistic is emphasized.
- The amount spent is sill increasing.
**Blindspots**
- There are people who are barely below the line, who have more difficulty paying for the plans.
- People of color are unequally affected.
- There are still ~20 million uninsured.
- Changes may be rolled back in future administrations.
## Alternative to US Healthcare
### Trump's Alternative
**Replacement**
- Similar work to ACA, not a full/clean repeal.
- **American Health Care Act** is what makes changes to ACA.
- Tax Credit Changes
	- ACA: Calculate with insurance costs and income. A town with high cost insurance and low income would get a higher tax credit.
	- AHCA: Flat, age-based rate. More people qualify but its not scaled to income. Less generous to some, more generous to others.
**Benefits of AHCA**
- Young, healthy people may find cheaper plans.
- Lower insurance cost may mean a higher tax credit.
- **No Mandate** - If you don't want insurance, you don't have to get it.
- Lower taxes for higher earners ($200k individuals, $250k couples).
- Cut back on government spending by pulling back extra funding for poor.
**Financial Incentive to Buy Insurance** - Even though it is no longer mandated, buying in later in life is more expensive. You benefit from buying insurance at a younger age, but it's still your choice.
**How much will it cost?** - Nobody knows, literally. They pushed their plan without getting a non-partisan (CBO) estimation.
**Estimations of Benefits**
- AHCA will reduce defecit (non-partisan issue) up to $337 billion by 2026.
- Savings come from reducing spending on health programs for low-income Americans by $880 billion over the next decade.
- 14 million to 24 million people would lose coverage.
	- BUT They can "choose to buy it back" with the HSA (Health Savings Account).
	- BUT some people can't afford to save money like that.
**Who Supported AHCA?** - The people who stood to lose the most.
**Changes to ACA**
- Medicaid would no longer cover mental health and addiction services.
## Lecture 7 - The Integrity of the Human Soul
### Two Extremes of Suffering
**Divine Sovereignty** - God rules over human existence.
- No matter what you do, bad things may still happen.
- While it isn't always understandable, we must accept it.
**Redemptive Suffering** - Suffering has meaning or redeemable aspects.
- Suffering teaches you about yourself and your world.
- There are positive outcomes to be gained from suffering.
**Combination**
- Accept suffering as part of life. Learn from it and know that you can't/shouldn't always fight it.
- Humans are coagents with God with a mission to alleviate suffering and despair in the world.
- So, both accept suffering and fight against it.
### Dualism - Form and Matter
**Form** - The mind/spirit.
- Trustworthy
- Associated with God.
- Associated with Men.
**Matter** - The physical body.
- Susceptible to temptation.
- Associated with Satan.
- Associated with Women.
**Problems**
- Too much distinction on one can harm the other.
## Religion and Healthcare

## Lecture 9
### Deontology and Categorical Imperative
**Deontology** - Duty or obligation.
- The decisions you make are based on your duty to humanity.
- Proposed by Immanuel Kant.
- The most honorable action is one that is not preferred but is done because it follows a categorical imperative.
**The Categorical Imperative** - In any scenario, the decision to be made is based on some higher rule (the categorical imperative). This rule is steadfast and all encompassing.
**Formalists** - Proponents of these theories are called formalists.
***A Priori*** - Decisions are made prior to emotion and interference, based on initial rules.
**Disadvantages**
- Takes advantage of victims.
	- Victims tend to be more emotionallu invested, but this system rejects emotions in favor of a universal truth. This benefits oppressive systems.
	- Who makes the rules?
### Teleology and Consequentialism
**Teleology** - Goal or outcome.
- The decisions you make are based on the outcome of those actions.
- Proposed by Bentham and J.S. Mills.
**Consequentialism** - In any scenario, the decision to be made is based on the potential outcome of any action. Better decisions make better outcomes.
**Utilitarianism** - A form of consequentialism focued on the greatest good for the greatest number.
***A Posteriori*** - Decisions are made after calculating potential outcomes.
**Disadvantages**
- Takes advantage of minority populations.
	- The existence of a greatest good for a greatest number implies the sacrifice of the minority number.
