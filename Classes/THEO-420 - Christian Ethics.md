## Lecture 1
### What is Christian Ethics?
**What is Ethics?**
- Ethics answer the quesions "what is going on in the world?" and "how should we live?"
- Ethics provides the tools to...
	- Formulate quesitons more precisely.
	- Understand historical responses to these questions.
**What is Christian Ethics?**
- Ethics with respect to stories, teachings, and symbols of Jesus and the resulting Christian traditions.
**Different Answers for Differen Quesitions** - Different forms of ethics lead to different answers. They may ask the question or measure success in a different way.
- Teleological Ethics - Did the action aim at and achieve a good result?
- Deontological Ethics - Did the action comform to a moral rule/duty?
- Virtue Ethics - Did the action fall in line with the qualities that make a good person?
- Utilitarian Ethics - Did the action produce a net positive outcome for the most possible people?
- Liberation Ethics - Did the action contribute to social justice/liberation?
**Relevant Ethics**
- Thought experiments like the trolley problem aren't beneficial to anyone.
- This class will focus on case studies to apply teachings to real life.
**Responsibility Ethics**
- We cannot know or fix everything, but we can do the next right thing.
## Lecture 2
### Think-Pair-Share
**Key Takeaways**
- The police seem to have blinders on. They use the motto "protect and serve" referring to citizens, but seem to only think about what happens to criminals (also, categorizing citizens/criminals is inappropriate). For example, the police were only concerned with catching a criminal on the night or Breonna's death, not with protecting the surrounding or involved citizens.
**Feelings**
- Living in Louisville carries a little more weight now. I realized how small it really is and how close this event was when I saw some of the interviewees at waterfront park, probably standing where I've stood before.
**What I Learned**
- One of the details that stuck out to me was how Breonna's mom didn't know what was happening until seeing an official report in the news.
**Questions**
- Why wasn't her mother informed at any point?
**Response**
- To the guy complaining about property damage from the protests:
	1. What is the value of a human life? Can is be said that some amount of property is more valuable than a human life?
	2. Both Breonna Taylor and George Floyd were credited as the inspirations of the protest. It's not just two people. If these two people have been publicly killed by police, that means that it's happened before and will happen again. Any interaction with the police, especially among minorities, has a chance to end in death without a rightful cause.
	3. To further the last point, the protest is not just over the death of two people. It's also about the death of countless others and future deaths for the same inexcusable reasons. So, for the price of multiple lives, how can it be said that any amount of property is more valuable?
	4. If you say that this was thr wrong way to respond, that it didn't result in any meaningful change: It resulted in this class. We would likely not be in this class if it weren't for the notoriety of and reaction to Breonna Taylor's killing.
## Lecture 3
### Stance/Perspective and Lovin's Writing
**Stance** - A perspective or vantage point of a person.
**Christian Stance** - Reflects beliefs commonly held by Christians.
- God and God's presence in Jesus.
**Three Ways of Reasoning** - Robin Lovin
1. Goals
2. Duties
3. Virtues
### History of Ethics
**Origin** - Ethics developed alongside the philosophy of and interaction between ancient cultures.
- India, China, Greece, and Palestine (Hebrew prophets) developed their own philosophies.
- These philosophies were mixed through interactions on trade routes like the Silk Road.
**Result** - The "idea that the most important thing is to connect justice and kindness to a right relationship to God," (Lovin).
### Greco-Roman Roots
**Greek Philosophy** - Right choices are guided by reason.
## Lecture 4 - Themes and Variations
### Response to In-Class Documentary
**Key Takeaways**
- The police involved in the raid were extrememly negligent/unprepared.
**Feelings**
- It's almost unbelievable that an officer can testify having little to no memory of firing an entire magazine at someone.
**What was New**
- I didn't realize how many shots were fired at first.
- It took a long time for anyone to go inside to check on Breonna Taylor.
**Questions**
- Is an officer's life more valuable than a citizens?
### Themes of the Christian Stance
These themes apply to all variations of the Christian stance.
1. **Creation** - God makes the world, everything is good.
2. **Sin** - Evil enters the world through human choices.
3. **Incarnation** - God took human form in Jesus Christ.
4. **Redemption** - Through Jesus, God offers redemption.
5. **Ressurection Destiny** - The point at which God's purposes will be fulfilled.
### Themes Alternative: Hermeneutical Key
1. Jesus announces His mission.
2. Jesus proposes a new ethical basis.
3. Jesus explains how judgement will be passed.
## Lecture 5
### Variations of the Christian Stance
**Synergy** - Christians live in a pluralistic world and should consider and work with others.
- Some do not share Christian faith, but public concensus can be reached.
- Natrual Law - The idea that humans share a rational capacity towards the good.
	- Universal human rights, common good.
**Integrity** - Refuses to cooperate with coercive power, withdraws from politics, and focuses on service, discipleship, virtue, and community.
- Hauerwas - Emphasized pacifism, local congregations, and service over politics.
- Ordinary Christian ethics is too narrow, Christians should instead focus on becoming peaceable disciples.
- But this variation leaves decisions up to non-Christians.
**Realism** - Focuses on human sinfulness and limitations, seeks to mitigate human evil and seek realistic progress rather than perfect outcomes.
- R. Niebuhr - Humans have sinful impulses and are driven towards power and violence. These impulses predominate in larger groups and societites.
- Humans can't make a good society, but should work towards one by restraining humanity's worst impulses.
**Liberation** - God sides with the oppressed.
- Find moral wisdom in the voices of marginalized people as they struggle against injustice.
- Emphasizes that Jesus was a poor peasant who spent his time with outcasts.
- Since God sides with the oppressed, theology and ethics are about assissting the oppressed in their liberation.
## Lecture 6 - Kelly Brown Douglas
### Introduction to *Ressurection Hope*
**Inspiration for the Book** - Responding to Her Son Desmond in 2020
- From Douglas' son: "How do we really know that God cares when Black people are still getting killed?"
**Major Claim** - "Anti-Blackness is embedded in the very theological fabric of Christianity."
### Initial Definitions
**Whiteness** - Not merely skin color, but a "socially constructed demarcation of race."
- Serves as a basis for privilege and power.
**White Supremacy** - "The network of systemic, strucural, and ideological realities that protect the 'presumed' superiority of whiteness."
- Grants certain privlieges to those raced as white and not to others.
## Lecture 7 -  Utilitarianism
### Modern Teleology
**Moral Calculus** - Is there a scientific/mathematical way to determine the greatest outcome?
- Pleasure-Pain principle.
**Jeremy Bentham** - Yes to moral calculus.
- All goods reduce to pleasure vs pain.
- The goal is to produce the greatest good for the greatest number.
**JS Mill** - Utilitariaism fulfills Jesus' golden rule.
### Discussion
1. Is Bentham right that all goods reduce to pleasure vs pain? Is Lovin right that there is no formula that a certain amount of health is worth a certain amount of achievement?
	- I think it's usually true that good exist on a scale. It could be an object, an experience, an action, but it always pushes you to an outcome where you are more or less happy. But it's not always possible to compare goods/outcomes.
2. Does utilitarianism capture the ethics of Jesus?
	- No. Utilitarianism is what lead to the persecution that Jesus detested.
3. What is the goal of living/being human? Pleasure, happiness, God, fulfillment, or other?
	- Fulfillment
## On Suffering
### Delores Williams
**Biographic**
- Lived 1937-2022
- Paul Tillich Professor of Theology and Culture at Union Theological Seminary in NYC
- Author of *Sisters in the Wilderness: The Challenge of Womanist God-Talk*.
- Womanist thought takes Black women's experience as a starting point for theological reflection.
	- Uses the experiences of Black women as a lens to interpret other text/cases.
- One of first Black women to earn a Ph.D. at Union. First Black woman professor at Union.
### In the Forest
**A Place to Meet** - Enslaved people would use the wilderness as a place to observe personal traditions out of sight of slave owners.
### Hagar at the Center
**Womanist Reading of Genesis 16 and 21**
- Abraham and Sarah own an enslave African woman named Hagar.
- A Womanist reading interprets the story from Hagar's point of view.
- Abraham and Sarah have complete dominion over Hagars's body and reproductive capabilities.
- Hagar becomes the first woman in the Bible to liberate herself from oppressive power.
- The only person in the Bible to give God a name.
### Hagar and Black Women
**Similarities**
- A female slave of African descent.
- Black women's history with surrogacy and exploitation.
**Hagar's Wilderness** - Hagar's escape into the wilderness is mirrored by the use of the wilderness by enslaved people as esacpe or for privacy from slave owners.
### Discussion
**What changes when you read the Bible with Hagar as the protagonist?**

1. This question reminds me of people who get arrested as a result of protesting for Palestine, and the cases of people who have set themselves on fire in protest. Jesus knew he would be killed if he kept his pace, but he kept going and sacrificed His body to the cause. He continued to disrupt the norm to the most extreme degree he could.
