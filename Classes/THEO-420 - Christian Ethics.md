## Lecture 1
### What is Christian Ethics?
**What is Ethics?**
- Ethics answer the quesions "what is going on in the world?" and "how should we live?"
- Ethics provides the tools to...
	- Formulate quesitons more precisely.
	- Understand historical responses to these questions.
**What is Christian Ethics?**
- Ethics with respect to stories, teachings, and symbols of Jesus and the resulting Christian traditions.
**Different Answers for Differen Quesitions** - Different forms of ethics lead to different answers. They may ask the question or measure success in a different way.
- Teleological Ethics - Did the action aim at and achieve a good result?
- Deontological Ethics - Did the action comform to a moral rule/duty?
- Virtue Ethics - Did the action fall in line with the qualities that make a good person?
- Utilitarian Ethics - Did the action produce a net positive outcome for the most possible people?
- Liberation Ethics - Did the action contribute to social justice/liberation?
**Relevant Ethics**
- Thought experiments like the trolley problem aren't beneficial to anyone.
- This class will focus on case studies to apply teachings to real life.
**Responsibility Ethics**
- We cannot know or fix everything, but we can do the next right thing.
## Lecture 2
### Think-Pair-Share
**Key Takeaways**
- The police seem to have blinders on. They use the motto "protect and serve" referring to citizens, but seem to only think about what happens to criminals (also, categorizing citizens/criminals is inappropriate). For example, the police were only concerned with catching a criminal on the night or Breonna's death, not with protecting the surrounding or involved citizens.
**Feelings**
- Living in Louisville carries a little more weight now. I realized how small it really is and how close this event was when I saw some of the interviewees at waterfront park, probably standing where I've stood before.
**What I Learned**
- One of the details that stuck out to me was how Breonna's mom didn't know what was happening until seeing an official report in the news.
**Questions**
- Why wasn't her mother informed at any point?
**Response**
- To the guy complaining about property damage from the protests:
	1. What is the value of a human life? Can is be said that some amount of property is more valuable than a human life?
	2. Both Breonna Taylor and George Floyd were credited as the inspirations of the protest. It's not just two people. If these two people have been publicly killed by police, that means that it's happened before and will happen again. Any interaction with the police, especially among minorities, has a chance to end in death without a rightful cause.
	3. To further the last point, the protest is not just over the death of two people. It's also about the death of countless others and future deaths for the same inexcusable reasons. So, for the price of multiple lives, how can it be said that any amount of property is more valuable?
	4. If you say that this was thr wrong way to respond, that it didn't result in any meaningful change: It resulted in this class. We would likely not be in this class if it weren't for the notoriety of and reaction to Breonna Taylor's killing.
## Lecture 3

**Stance** - A perspective or vantage point of a person.

### History of Ethics
**Origin** - Ethics developed alongside the philosophy of and interaction between ancient cultures.
- India, China, Greece, and Palestine (Hebrew prophets) developed their own philosophies.
- These philosophies were mixed through interactions on trade routes like the Silk Road.
**Result** - The "idea that the most important thing is to connect justice and kindness to a right relationship to God," (Lovin).
### Greco-Roman Roots
