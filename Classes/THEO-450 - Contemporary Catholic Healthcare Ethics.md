## Chapter 1 - Religion and Healthcare
### Introduction
**The Basis for Bioethics** - Kelly asserts that religious debates about healthcare are the basis for modern bioethics.
- Western culture tends to ignore the history of religious debates about healthcare.
- Assumes that biotethics is a completely new area of study.
- But religions were doing it first, and still make useful arguments.
**Historical Precedence** - Countless civilizations have combined medicine and religion.
## Chapter 2 - The Dignity of Human Life
### Theological Basis
**A Basis of Healthcare Ethics** - Healtcare assumes that every human has innate worth. Catholic tradition argues for the value of human life from two bases: creation and redemption.
- **Creation** - God created humans with a special purpose/place within His design.
- **Redemption** - When humans were tainted by sin, God offered His son to relieve them.
**Expanding on Creation and Redemption** - It is also argued that Jesus' sacrifice was not simply God's 'response' to sin. Instead, it was God's predestined plan to share divinity with humanity. That's another good reason to value every human life.
**Images of God** - Humans were made in God's image, and started as almost divine beings free of imperfection.
**Dualism** - The distinction between human body and soul.
- Some traditions imply that the image of God is only the human soul and that the body is fundamentally flawed.
- There is little evidence for this in scripture. Instead, both body and soul should be valued.
