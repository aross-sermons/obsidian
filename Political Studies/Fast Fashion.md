	This entry is based on a video titled "It's Not Just Shein: Why Are ALL Your Clothes Worse Now?" The video is produced by Sanya Dosani and can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCwbU41Icfw).

### Part 1 - Clothing Quality
**The Encheapening**
	Many of today's popular clothing brands used to be expensive and high-quality. Over the past two decades, these brands have gotten more affordable at the cost of quality. Dosani points out that the majority of clothing at an Abercrombie features loose/torn threads, 100% synthetic materials, and cheap prices.
**Notes From an Industry Professional**

	1. Clothes don't fit as well
	2. Clothes don't last as long
